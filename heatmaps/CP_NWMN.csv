Subunits IIA, IIB, and IIC are encoded by the sgaA, sgaB, and sgaT genes of the E. coli sgaTBA operon. In some bacteria, the IIB (SgaB) domain is fused C-terminal to the IIA (SgaT) domain. The IIB domain fold includes a central four-stranded parallel open twisted beta-sheet flanked by alpha-helices on both sides. The seven major PTS systems with this IIB fold include ascorbate, chitobiose/lichenan, lactose, galactitol, mannitol, fructose, and a sensory system with similarity to the bacterial bgl system.",,,,

Group I TRX is a small ancient protein that alter the redox state of target proteins via the reversible oxidation of an active site dithiol, present in a CXXC motif, partially exposed at the protein's surface. TRX reduces protein disulfide bonds, resulting in a disulfide bond at its active site. Oxidized TRX is converted to the active form by TRX reductase, using reducing equivalents derived from either NADPH or ferredoxins. By altering their redox state, TRX regulates the functions of at least 30 target proteins, some of which are enzymes and transcription factors. It also plays an important role in the defense against oxidative stress by directly reducing hydrogen peroxide and certain radicals, and by serving as a reductant for peroxiredoxins. At least two major types of functional TRXs have been reported in most organisms; in eukaryotes, they are located in the cytoplasm and the mitochondria. Higher plants contain more types (at least 20 TRX genes have been detected in the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana), two of which (types f amd m) are located in the same compartment, the chloroplast. Also included in the alignment are TRX-like domains which show sequence homology to TRX but do not contain the redox active CXXC motif. Group II proteins, in addition to either a redox active TRX or a TRX-like domain, also contain additional domains, which may or may not possess homology to known proteins.",,,,

Enzymes of this family generate radicals by combining a 4Fe-4S cluster and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) in close proximity. They are characterized by a conserved CxxxCxxC motif, which coordinates the conserved iron-sulfur cluster. Mechanistically, they share the transfer of a single electron from the iron-sulfur cluster to SAM, which leads to its reductive cleavage to methionine and a 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical, which, in turn, abstracts a hydrogen from the appropriately positioned carbon atom. Depending on the enzyme, SAM is consumed during this process or it is restored and reused. Radical SAM enzymes catalyze steps in metabolism, DNA repair, the biosynthesis of vitamins and coenzymes, and the biosynthesis of many antibiotics. Examples are biotin synthase (BioB), lipoyl synthase (LipA), pyruvate formate-lyase (PFL), coproporphyrinogen oxidase (HemN), lysine 2,3-aminomutase (LAM), anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase (ARR), and MoaA, an enzyme of the biosynthesis of molybdopterin.",,,,

This enzyme hydrolyzes peptides containing between 7 and 17 amino acids with fairly broad specificity. The PepF gene is duplicated in L. lactis on the plasmid that bears it, while a shortened second copy is found in Bacillus subtilis. Most bacterial PepFs are cytoplasmic endopeptidases; however, the PepF Bacillus amyloliquefaciens oligopeptidase is a secreted protein and may facilitate the process of sporulation. Specifically, the yjbG gene encoding the homolog of the PepF1 and PepF2 oligoendopeptidases of Lactococcus lactis has been identified in Bacillus subtilis as an inhibitor of sporulation initiation when over expressed from a multicopy plasmid. Active site contains an HEXXH sequence motif, characteristic of a large class of zinc metallopeptidases. The two histidines coordinate the zinc ion while a downstream glutamate serves as the third zinc ligand. The glutamate residue of the HEXXH motif is believed to play an important role in the reaction mechanism, polarizing and orienting a zinc-coordinating water molecule.",,,,

A bound metal ion is required for protein activities for the members of this superfamily. A variety of metal ions have been found in the catalytic centers of these proteins including Fe(II), Mn(II), Zn(II), Ni(II) and Mg(II). Type I extradiol dioxygenases catalyze the incorporation of both atoms of molecular oxygen into aromatic substrates, which results in the cleavage of aromatic rings. They are key enzymes in the degradation of aromatic compounds. Type I extradiol dioxygenases include class I and class II enzymes. Class I and II enzymes show sequence similarity; the two-domain class II enzymes evolved from a class I enzyme through gene duplication. Glyoxylase I catalyzes the glutathione-dependent inactivation of toxic methylglyoxal, requiring zinc or nickel ions for activity. The antibiotic resistance proteins in this family use a variety of mechanisms to block the function of antibiotics. Bleomycin resistance protein (BLMA) sequesters bleomycin's activity by directly binding to it. Whereas, three types of fosfomycin resistance proteins employ different mechanisms to render fosfomycin inactive by modifying the fosfomycin molecule. Although the proteins in this superfamily are functionally distinct, their structures are similar. The difference among the three dimensional structures of the three types of proteins in this superfamily is interesting from an evolutionary perspective. Both glyoxalase I and BLMA show domain swapping between subunits. However, there is no domain swapping for type 1 extradiol dioxygenases.",,,,

Oligo-1,6-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.10) hydrolyzes the alpha-1,6-glucosidic linkage of isomaltooligosaccharides, pannose, and dextran. Unlike alpha-1,4-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.20), it fails to hydrolyze the alpha-1,4-glucosidic bonds of maltosaccharides. Dextran glucosidase (DGase, EC 3.2.1.70) hydrolyzes alpha-1,6-glucosidic linkages at the non-reducing end of panose, isomaltooligosaccharides and dextran to produce alpha-glucose.The common reaction chemistry of the alpha-amylase family enzymes is based on a two-step acid catalytic mechanism that requires two critical carboxylates: one acting as a general acid/base (Glu) and the other as a nucleophile (Asp). Both hydrolysis and transglycosylation proceed via the nucleophilic substitution reaction between the anomeric carbon, C1 and a nucleophile. Both enzymes contain the three catalytic residues (Asp, Glu and Asp) common to the alpha-amylase family as well as two histidine residues which are predicted to be critical to binding the glucose residue adjacent to the scissile bond in the substrates. The Alpha-amylase family comprises the largest family of glycoside hydrolases (GH), with the majority of enzymes acting on starch, glycogen, and related oligo- and polysaccharides. These proteins catalyze the transformation of alpha-1,4 and alpha-1,6 glucosidic linkages with retention of the anomeric center. The protein is described as having 3 domains: A, B, C. A is a (beta/alpha) 8-barrel; B is a loop between the beta 3 strand and alpha 3 helix of A; C is the C-terminal extension characterized by a Greek key. The majority of the enzymes have an active site cleft found between domains A and B where a triad of catalytic residues performs catalysis. Other members of this family have lost the catalytic activity as in the case of the human 4F2hc, or only have 2 residues that serve as the catalytic nucleophile and the acid/base, such as Thermus A4 beta-galactosidase with 2 Glu residues (GH42) and human alpha-galactosidase with 2 Asp residues (GH31). The family members are quite extensive and include: alpha amylase, maltosyltransferase, cyclodextrin glycotransferase, maltogenic amylase, neopullulanase, isoamylase, 1,4-alpha-D-glucan maltotetrahydrolase, 4-alpha-glucotransferase, oligo-1,6-glucosidase, amylosucrase, sucrose phosphorylase, and amylomaltase.",,,,

GTP cyclohydrolase II catalyzes the conversion of GTP to 2,5-diamino-6-ribosylamino-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 5' phosphate, formate, pyrophosphate (APy), and GMP in the biosynthetic pathway of riboflavin. Riboflavin is the precursor molecule for the synthesis of the coenzymes flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) which are essential to cell metabolism. The enzyme is present in plants and numerous pathogenic bacteria, especially gram negative organisms, who are dependent on endogenous synthesis of the vitamin because they lack an appropriate uptake system. For animals and humans, which lack this biosynthetic pathway, riboflavin is the essential vitamin B2. GTP cyclohydrolase II requires magnesium ions for activity and has a bound catalytic zinc. The functionally active form is thought to be a homodimer. A paralogous protein is encoded in the genome of Streptomyces coelicolor, which converts GTP to 2-amino-5-formylamino-6-ribosylamino-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 5'-phosphate (FAPy), an activity that has otherwise been reported for unrelated GTP cyclohydrolases III.",,,,

The family contains the CAAX prenyl protease. The proteins contain a highly conserved Glu-Glu motif at the amino end of the alignment. The alignment also contains two histidine residues that may be involved in zinc binding. While they are involved in membrane anchoring of proteins in eukaryotes, little is known about their function in prokaryotes. In some known bacteriocin loci, Abi genes have been found downstream of bacteriocin structural genes where they are probably involved in self-immunity. Investigation of the bacteriocin-like loci in the Gram positive bacteria locus from Lactobacillus sakei 23K confirmed that the bacteriocin-like genes (sak23Kalphabeta) exhibited antimicrobial activity when expressed in a heterologous host and that the associated Abi gene (sak23Ki) conferred immunity against the cognate bacteriocin. Interestingly, the immunity genes from three similar systems conferred a high degree of cross-immunity against each other's bacteriocins, suggesting the recognition of a common receptor. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the conserved motifs constituting the putative proteolytic active site of the Abi proteins are essential for the immunity function of Sak23Ki - thus a new concept in self-immunity.",,,,

The domain architecture of the IIB-containing protein includes a region N-terminal to the IIB domain which is homologous to the BglG transcription antiterminator with an RNA-binding domain followed by two homologous domains, PRD1 and PRD2 (PTS Regulation Domains). C-terminal to the IIB domain is a domain similar to the PTS IIA domain. In this system, the BglG-like region and the IIB and IIA-like domains are all expressed together as a single multidomain protein. The IIB domain fold includes a central four-stranded parallel open twisted beta-sheet flanked by alpha-helices on both sides. The seven major PTS systems with this IIB fold include this sensory system with similarity to the bacterial bgl system, chitobiose/lichenan, ascorbate, lactose, galactitol, mannitol, and fructose systems.",,,,
